      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>
        I work at the intersection of kidney health, research, and community
        advocacy. My days are spent pushing for equity in transplant access,
        supporting patients, and helping reshape systems that have failed Black
        and Brown communities for generations. My lived experience as a kidney
        transplant recipient guides the heart of my work.
      </p>

      <p>
        My coding journey started because I needed better tools to serve people.
        I realized that the websites, platforms, and digital systems meant to
        support patients were outdated, confusing, and built without our
        communities in mind. Learning to code became a way to take back that
        power — to build my own tools, my own platforms, and my own solutions
        for the work I do in healthcare.
      </p>

      <p>
        I insist on learning web development because the healthcare space needs
        more people who understand both the lived experience and the technology
        behind the systems. Coding gives me the ability to create accessible
        resources, improve patient education, and design platforms that honor
        the communities I fight for every day.
      </p>
